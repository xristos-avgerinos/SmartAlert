# SmartAlert
An android App project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of "Software Technology".

The team was asked to implement an android application, with the aim of immediately notifying citizens in high-risk emergency situations. Our application supports two user roles. Citizens and civil protection employees. After logging in to their account, citizens will be able to add a high-risk incident or see statistics about activated incidents. On the other hand, the civil protection officer will "see" the submitted high-risk situations and, depending on the risk index, will choose the automatic notification of the users who are in a short radius of the high-risk incident, or reject the alarm, or examine the incident in other ways and will again choose to notify users, or dismiss the incident.

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
